Alx hbnb project aim to create a duplicate of Airbnb by diving in web development starting with creating command interpreter to manage Airbnb clone objects

## What does a command interpreter do?
- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object
